1. What is wrong with the following argument: All supermen can
fly. Therefore, there is a superman.

2. Can the following formulas be unabiguously parsed?
   - p \/ q /\ r 
   - p \/ q \/r
   - NOT p \/ (p XOR q) <=> p /\ q

3. Encode the following puzzle in proposotional logic: People are
   either good or bad. The good people always tell the truth and the
   bad people always tell a lie. Now let us consider the following
   question.  There are two people A and B. A said some thing, but we
   could not hear it. B said, “A is saying that A is bad”. What are A
   and B?

4. Prove the theorem: In propositional logic, a proper prefix of a
   formula is not a formula.

5. Prove the theorem: Each formula f \in P (language of Propositional logic) has a
   unique parsing tree.

6. Given a model and a parse tree of a formula f, give the
   satisfiability checking procedure.

7. Prove the theorem: The satisfiability problem of any formula f in P
   (language of Propositional logic) is decidable.

8. Give the procedure to decide the validity of a formula in propositional logic.

9. Show that f[BOT / p] /\ f[TOP / p ] |= F (where f[a/b] stands for
   substituting b for a in f).
